# Reversi

The goal of this project is to create a [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) implementation, and get some Haskell experience in the process.

##### Rough plan
- [x] Encode game board & rules
- [x] Create some GUI
- [ ] Implement some evaluation function and strategy so that computer can be played against
- [ ] Apply some ML, probably in AlphaGo Zero fashion where computer plays against itself and thereby improves its skill
